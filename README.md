# Binary Tree
This is a kind of list that uses nodes to automatically sort the information that is stored within it upon entering in order to more easily access that information later. The nodes form a sort of upside down tree structure with the nodes acting as the root, branches, and leaves. The tree itself is what draws the lines between the nodes that connects them. Bringing the whole tree together.
# What to Expect
The application itself is a blank screen with an input box and two buttons to **insert** and **remove**. To add an element to the screen, simply type your desired integer into the box and click the **insert** button. The node added should appear on screen colored green. If a node is green, this is how you will know you have that node selected. Attempting to insert another node with the same value will result in the node that is in the tree turning green. To remove an element, type the number into the box and click remove. The node will be removed, and any children it had will be sorted in the list accordingly.

Keep in mind, the data has to be an integer. It cannot be negative, and it cannot go over 100.
